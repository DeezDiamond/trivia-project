# Trivia

- Trivia is a multiple choice game in which the player selects the correct answer to satisfy the question that's asked of them. Correct answers add to a tally of points for the player, and incorrect answers offer brief education on the appropriate response so that the player can continue with the game.

## Challenges

- Designing a trivia game, the biggest hurdle was getting the choices to be responsive when the player wants to select one. I especially wanted to keep accessibility in mind for both mobile users and users who may not have the dexterity to aim for a small check box or radio button when choosing an answer.

- After making entire sentences clickable, I wanted to make it a little more obvious that the whole sentence could be clicked on by enveloping the entirety of a choice in a different color which stands out from the background.
